This app was created with SvelteKit, and uses Tailwind and jsPDF to provide functionality.

The sole user of this app will essentially edit a template that is layed out for him. If I wanted to, I could
hook this up to a server and actually have this running where he can create templates, but he didn't want that, he 
specifically wanted this template editable, so I guess this is it.

It will be hosted on github pages when closer to being completed.
